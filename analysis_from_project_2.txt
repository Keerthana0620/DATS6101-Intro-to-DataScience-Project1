we got very good AUC and roc curve, also good predictions in the first model with state and county and every other variable i mentioned
but the AIC is much higher than your basic model, which meant that my first model is very bad
even though the logistic regression said all variables are significant
the odds ratio gave 0s and inf indicating the small variables are useless and some variabels gives perfect separation.
this perfect separation may because the lila is derived from lowincome. multicolinearity problem.
if lila is derived from lowincome we can't use it, its like giving the answers for an exam
