Project Description:

We have observed that our friends and family members in the USA are encountering challenges
when it comes to accessing groceries. Some reside in remote rural areas, while others live in
close proximity to urban centers, yet they all face this issue. Consequently, we have chosen to
investigate the phenomenon of Food Deserts, which often go unnoticed, existing both within city
centers and in rural regions. According to the USDA, residing in a food desert is defined as
"living more than one mile from a supermarket in urban or suburban areas and more than 10
miles from a supermarket in rural areas." Notably, we have observed a recent increase in the
prevalence of food deserts, and we hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic may be a
contributing factor. To gain a deeper insight and develop strategies to address food deserts, this
study will utilize Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and decision trees to analyze and forecast
their prevalence and features. Additionally, we will explore how variables such as age, race,
income, poverty rate, and vehicle accessibility may affect the status of food deserts. The
overarching aim is to contribute towards the eradication of hunger across the United States.
